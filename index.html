    <h1>Bicycle Workshop</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Tired of walking into a bike shop not knowing what needs to be fixed/how much it'd cost to fix what not? </p>
    <p>Did you ever end up paying more than necessarily to fix something trivial otherwise? </p>
    <p>We decided to organize this workshop so next time we'd be better informed/could fix small stuff on our own.</p>
